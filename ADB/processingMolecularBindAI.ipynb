    "### **1. Class Distribution (Binds Column)**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Observation**:\n",
    "  - Total rows: ~295 million.\n",
    "  - Binders (`binds = 1`): ~1.59 million (~0.54% of total data).\n",
    "  - Non-binders (`binds = 0`): ~293.7 million (~99.46% of total data).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Insight**:\n",
    "  - The dataset is **highly imbalanced**, with binders being extremely rare.\n",
    "  - Imbalance at this level means:\n",
    "    - A naïve model might predict \"non-binding\" for all examples and still achieve >99% accuracy.\n",
    "    - Special techniques like **oversampling** the minority class, **undersampling** the majority class, or using **class-weighted loss functions** are necessary to ensure the model learns to recognize binders effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Actionable Steps**:\n",
    "  - Consider **stratified sampling** to create a balanced subset for local testing.\n",
    "  - Use **evaluation metrics** like precision, recall, or F1 score rather than accuracy to assess model performance.\n",

    "    - **sEH**: ~98.4 million rows.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Insight**:\n",
    "  - The balanced representation ensures that all three proteins are equally represented in training, reducing bias toward one target.\n",
    "  - **BRD4** has fewer binders (~456,964) compared to **sEH** (~724,532) and **HSA** (~408,410).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Actionable Steps**:\n",
    "  - If modeling each protein separately, be aware of the variation in binding proportions across proteins.\n",
    "  - Analyze why BRD4 has the fewest binders—it could be due to the chemical or structural properties of its binding pocket.\n",

    "\n",
    "- **Insight**:\n",
    "  - The lack of missing data simplifies preprocessing—no need for imputation.\n",
    "  - The numerical `id` column doesn’t provide any meaningful features for the model and can be ignored during training.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Actionable Steps**:\n",
    "  - Focus on the **SMILES strings** and **protein_name** as features for modeling.\n",
    "  - Drop the `id` column unless it is needed for tracking results.\n",

    "\n",
    "- **Insight**:\n",
    "  - The proportion of binders varies slightly by protein:\n",
    "    - **sEH** has the highest proportion of binders, making it relatively easier to model.\n",
    "    - **BRD4** has the lowest proportion, making it harder to model binding accurately.\n",
    "  - This variation suggests that different proteins might require **separate models** or **protein-specific feature engineering**.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Actionable Steps**:\n",
    "  - Consider building **individual models for each protein** to account for differences in binding dynamics.\n",

    "\n",
    "- **Insight**:\n",
    "  - The dataset’s chemical information is intact and ready for feature extraction.\n",
    "  - This reduces the need for extensive cleaning or validation in this area.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Actionable Steps**:\n",
    "  - Use a library like **RDKit** to compute molecular descriptors (e.g., fingerprints, molecular weight) from SMILES strings.\n",

    "- **Actionable Steps**:\n",
    "  - Use **ECFP fingerprints** or **pre-trained embeddings** (e.g., Mol2Vec or ChemBERTa) for molecule representation.\n",

    "### **Summary of Key Insights and Next Steps**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Imbalance**:\n",
    "   - The dataset is highly imbalanced; focus on oversampling, undersampling, or class-weighted loss functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Protein Differences**:\n",
    "   - Binding proportions vary by protein; consider protein-specific models or features.\n",

    "   - The dataset is complete, reducing preprocessing complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **SMILES Strings**:\n",
    "   - Molecules are valid and diverse, making it suitable for advanced molecular feature extraction.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Focus Areas**:\n",
    "   - Drop unnecessary columns (`id`).\n",
    "   - Extract meaningful features from SMILES and protein names.\n",
